ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to code in python without throwing my laptop out my window.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about preferably nothing, unless you need help, then i'm always open to help with anything except if it's got something to do with cooking.

âš¡ Fun fact: Polar bears are actually black, they just have white fur.
